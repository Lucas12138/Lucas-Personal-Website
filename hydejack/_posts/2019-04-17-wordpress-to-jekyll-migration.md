# Blog Migration - From Wordpress To Jekyll
# Introduction

Wordpress and Jekyll are both very handy tools to manage contents. But, they do share some differences.


Wordpress is more sophisticated and easier to use. The user can create contents, administrate the website, or use

all kinds of plugins via the portal. However, the deployment of a Wordpress based blog website could be more difficult.

People usually use the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP) to host the Wordpress. Therefore, users need to find

some servers to deploy the blog service, such as AWS EC2. Then, some extra costs occur. A t2.micro(with EBS) on AWS could cost less than $10 per month.


Jekyll requires writing some markdown, HTML, or [Liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/). Although it has some templates,

it's slightly more difficult to use. However, it's very easy to deploy. For example, you can deploy the Jekyll based blog

via Github pages for free.   

# Migration steps

## 1. Use the exporter plugin (on Wordpress admin page)

The [exporter plugin](https://github.com/benbalter/wordpress-to-jekyll-exporter) is just like other Wordpress plugins.

Follow the plugin instructions. You will be able to download a zip file. The exporter will convert your Wordpress page into a vanilla Jekyll page.

## 2. Install the jekyll

The steps of the installation vary among different systems. You can refer to the instruction [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/).

Note:

The steps of installing Jekyll on Mac didn't work perfectly on my machine.

The following command worked for me.

```aidl
sudo gem install -n /usr/local/bin jekyll
```  

## 3. Find a cool theme

People want a cool UI. It worth spending some time searching for one.

You can use the following websites to find one.

* https://github.com/planetjekyll/awesome-jekyll-themes
* https://jekyllthemes.io/jekyll-blog-themes

I'm using [Hydejack](https://hydejack.com/) for my blog.

## 4. Follow the themeâ€™s README instructions and set up Github pages

Usually, the themes have README instructions on how to set up the blog.

You would need to use [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) for blog deployment as well.

## 5. Copy the posts from the export folder to the new local Jekyll repo

In the zip file generated by the exporter, there's a **_post** and a **wp-content** folder.

You would like to replace the posts under the theme's starter _post folder with the posts under the generated _post folder.

You also need to copy the wp-content to the theme's root folder.

## 6. Make some changes to the starting template

The default settings may not be good enough. You probably want to have some customization.
 
For example, you can add a categories page, update the AUTHOR/ABOUT page, add some contact information etc.

## 7. Update the posts

The generated posts may contain img tags with the source of your previous DNS.

You need to update that to a local URL, \{\{site.baseurl\}\}.

## 8. Bind to the DNS (using AWS Route 53 in my case)

I purchased my DNS via AWS. Therefore, I'm using AWS Route 53. Other service providers should share a similar approach.

If you want to use AWS Route 53 with Github pages. You can refer to [this](https://samyounger.com/github/git/github-pages/aws/route53/2017/02/15/github-pages-with-aws.html).
